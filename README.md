### Howdy there!

I'm Safia (rhymes with Mafia). I spend a lot of my time on GitHub.

By day, I help build the [Blazor](https://blazor.net) framework as part of my role at Microsoft. By night, I help maintain the [nteract](https://nteract.io) ecosystem.

As you can see, I love the creativity and collaboration that comes with working in open source!
